/*This is an example of what a campaign will look like
*/
ID:1;
name:campaign1;
notes:this is an example;
picture:pi:1,pi:2;

the javascript will look at each tag and if it needs campaign 1 then it will add each section to the proper place dynamicaly
this is why this file doesn't need to be of a html file type.
each line is ended with a ; to denote the end of what is in that section.
it is also simple to allow it to be easer to add more later with the javascript.
