the javascript will look at each tag and if it needs campaign 1 then it will add each section to the proper place dynamicaly
this is why this file doesn't need to be of a html file type.
each line is ended with a ; to denote the end of what is in that section.
it is also simple to allow it to be easer to add more later with the javascript.

this will make each campaign keep track of what is where so that default premade campaigns can be made
other nodes will not keep track of what nodes are attached to it
