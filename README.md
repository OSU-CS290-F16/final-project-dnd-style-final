#Final Project CS290

This Project will be an applications to help with organizing a dungens and dragons game so that the game master will have and easer time keeping track of what is where.

The basic organization is that of a family tree.
First the user will be presented with a page where they can chose to make a new campaign or see the details of one that already exists.

All the nodes once the user is in them will have the option to see information or pictures that are attached to that spicific node.

The nodes in decending rank are campaign, town, location, NPC, and picture.

A node can add any node to it that is at a lower rank.
So a campaign can add any except for a campaign where as a location can only have NPC nodes added to it.

In each node there will be options to see a list of nodes added to it seporated by node type and if no nodes of that type are attached to it them then there will be no option to see that type of node.

The options and node lists will be displayed like sticky notes to allow for some small information on that option or node to be displayed allong with the option so that the user can get some of the relevent information right off the bat without clicking into the node.
