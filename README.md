#Final Project CS290

This Project will be an applications to help with organizing a dungens and dragons game so that the game master will have and easer time keeping track of what is where.

The basic organization is that of a family tree.
First the user will be presented with a page where they can chose to make a new campaign or see the details of one that already exists.

All the nodes once the user is in them will have the option to see information and pictures that are attached to that spicific node. This information will be displayed with pictures on one side and any details on the other.

The nodes in decending rank are campaign, town, location, and NPC.

A node can add any node to it that is at a lower rank.
So a campaign can add any except for a campaign where as a location can only have NPC nodes added to it.

In each node there will be options to see a list of nodes added to it seporated by node type and if no nodes of that type are attached to it them then there will be no option to see that type of node.
